There’s less clarity of StoreType impact in the middle of the cone shaped scatter, but we can certainly see the impact of Customers and Sales conditional on the StoreType mostly in the outer regions of the visualization. Thus StoreType is a relevant feature, but as a function of Customers, as we can see that around 2000 to 3000 Customers there’s a break in the cluster pattern of the middle section of the cone.

The Kaggle competition consisted in predicted the next 6 weeks (or 42 days), our splitting lead to have a testing set very large of over 900 days, explaining the fast degradation of the explained variance. These issues are the same the world of finance and economics are facing. For example the usage of an AR(n) to predict future outcomes quickly converge to a stationary states. In a real world, one would adjust the model based on the observed error. This is the spirit of tools such as the 'Kalman Filter' that are usually implemented in these domains.* \n",

    "*One other potential approach would consist in implementing more complicated model that naturally combine time series and decision tree, such as ART (Autoregressive Trees). The proposed method are outside of the scope of this course and thus we will focus on some other tehniques here.*"

    "It has been well established that bagging and other resampling techniques can be used to reduce the variance in model predictions. As several replicates of the original data set are created using random selection with replacement, at every step, each derivative data set is then used to construct a new model and the models are gathered together into an ensemble. To make a prediction, all of the models in the ensemble are polled and their results are averaged in the case of regression, which is our specific approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well, it has been well established that a powerful modeling algorithm that makes good use of bagging is Random Forests, which works by training numerous decision trees each based on a different resampling of the original training data. The random forest algorithm improves on bagging by training each tree on a random sample of the available features, to prevent each tree from choosing the same predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Random Forests the bias of the full model is equivalent to the bias of a single decision tree, which itself has high variance. By creating many of these trees, a forest, and then averaging them, the variance of the final model can be greatly reduced over that of a single tree. In practice the only limitation we encountered on the size of the forest is computing time, as an infinite number of trees could be trained without ever increasing bias and with a continual - if asymptotically declining - decrease in the variance.\n",
